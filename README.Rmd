## Overview
This application allows to manipulate output data files from [ARIS Explorer 3000](http://www.soundmetrics.com/products/aris-sonars/aris-explorer-3000) ([SMC](http://www.soundmetrics.com/)).
This one allows you to specifically select the "Manual Marking" section of an output data file to use it as usuable tables (.txt) for R software (or other).

## Utilization

We can access the web application [here](https://github-carrtel.shinyapps.io/arissaglisse)
